# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The Tableau project consisted in building a story and answering questions from a particular dataset while using the software, by exploring the dataset and thinking about what kind of relationships and subsequent visualisations we could make according to what we wanted to portray from the data.
The goal is to put our learning to the test with Tableau software and getting comfortable with the features by building different visualisations.

## Process
I chose the FAA wildlife strikes data from 2000 to 2015 just because I thought it was the most interesting dataset among the choices.
I started just by exploring the dataset by building rudimentary graphs and exploring what would be the best type of presentation for different types of data.
After exploring through the data, I wanted to create visualisations for the amount of strikes per wildlife species, which themselves could be filtered according to US states and by year, the cost in terms of grounded flights and money, what kind of damage the strikes did to the aircrafts and at what moment of flight did the impacts occur. 

## Results
What are the most vulnerable species?
Overall for the continental US, the 3 wildlife species that are the most vulnerable based on the number of strikes are Mourning doves, Gulls and Barn Swallows. Their effect is mostly negligible based on the amount of instances where no damage is evaluated from the strikes. In the case of mourning doves, take-off needs to be aborted, while for gulls, the plane needs to make a precautionary landing more often.
In the state of California for example, the top 3 wildlife species with the most strikes are gulls, rock pigeons and red-tailed hawks, with all 3 inciting more precautionary landings than other impacts, right after “no impact” strikes.

At what point of the flight are wildlife strikes more likely?
This question is a bit vague, because answers do differ based on species and state. In California for example, the top 3 species are all the most vulnerable during the approach, while the 4th most vulnerable species, the cliff swallow, is the most vulnerable during the landing roll.
In Montana, the top 3 most vulnerable species are the horned lark during the take-off runs, gulls during the approach and American kestrels during the take-off runs.
I think based on the vulnerable species and moment of flight factors, we could start thinking about how to reduce ecological impacts by finding out what the common factors are between different species and different moments of flights and then figure out some ways to prevent as many wildlife strikes based on that information. However, this is very case by case, as different states have different species getting hit at different moments of flight. Overall though, it seems like the approach stage seems to be the moment of the flight that produces the most wildlife strikes.

What are the future projections?
Wildlife strikes seems to be on the rise, which just pretty much confirms that a solutions should be considered to reduce the number, especially if  from a socio-economic standpoint, the more wildlife strikes there are, the more likely that the number of significant impacts are going to rise as well, costing a lot of money and a lot of hours of flight delays which would lead to more frustration from a customer point of view. Obviously, it would be nice to consider the ecological impacts on wildlife first, but unfortunately it doesn’t seem like our society as a whole really attributes much importance to that aspect just yet.

## Challenges 
I think the challenges for this project were mainly determining the scope of the project. Obviously having chosen Option 2, I was lightly guided rather than prompted for specific questions. It was a bit hard to decide which data I wanted to use, as well as what kind of questions I wanted to answer, what I wanted to show through visualisation and in which manner to present the information.

## Future Goals
As for future goals, I think I would have definitely liked to maybe produce at least one type of  “show me” visualisation for all the data available, just to get a better sense of the best ways to present different data, and find new ways to show off data rather than typical, basic graphs. I also definitely would have loved to make better use of the forecasting tool.
